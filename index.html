            Hello there! This is a built to practice my newfound coding skills, courtesy of <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, the google, and the always late bus, every day. The site uses html, CSS, and bootstrap, and gives a bit of information about myself, guarenteed to be over 90% true.
          </p>
          <p>
            More seriously, I'm learning to code because it seems to be our era's equivalent of writing or personal skills - no matter where you go, it will serve you well. We have these powerful tools that can make repetitive tasks disappear, and yet somehow, most of us don't understand how they work. As a person who likes understanding how things work, I thought it was time to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plan, if the geology and photography and general tenor of the site don't make it clear already, is to take these skills and apply them to some of the things I care about, namely the outdoors. The downside of this tech is that, fun as it may be to make it, using it can be corrosive to our well-being. We need to get outside more! So I'm hoping to work on tools that help people find local hikes and resources. Technology to get us away from technology.

          <p>These projects are from my first week of coding. Nothing fancy, less complete, and all made with the help of others. Many thanks to my fellow epicoders.</p>
          <ul class="body-text">
            <li>My most basic is the most classic: <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/hello-world">Hello World</a>, in pure, unfettered html.</li>
            <li>If we were Hawiian, it would all be aloha. But alas, we must say <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/goodbye/blob/master/goodbye.html">goodbye</a>.</li>
            <li>It's no matter. We can console ourselves with the many sizes of <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/cookie">cookie</a> that html headings allow for.</li>
            <li>This was followed by images, of the feline variety, because <strong>of course.</strong> Good topic for <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/my-first-webpage">my first webpage</a>.</li>
            <li>More practice begat <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/webpage2/blob/master/index.html">my second webpage!</a></li>
            <li>With ordered lists, blockquotes, divs, and so on, we built a little <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/vacation/blob/master/index.html">travel website</a>.</li>
            <li>We put a days's worth of CSS styling lessons into one site, with the curious theme of <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/vacation/blob/master/index.html">fish cupcakes. </a>Don't ask.</li>
            <li>The most rewarding thus far is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap</a>, but that gets kind of <a href="https://github.com/ericschoettle/vacation/blob/master/index.html">meta</a>.</li>

            By training and by disposition, I'm a geologist. Jokes about beards and beer here - and apologises for the subtle sexism of beard jokes about geologists. Many of the best geologists I know (about 50%!) are in the permanently-non-bearded club. But geology is the field for the polyglot scientist - you get to dabble in every field you like, and most of all, tie them all togehter. It's the field for the outdoorsman. It's the field for the traveller. It's the field for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lucky enough to discover geology at Whitman College, nestled in the palouse hills, neighbor to the infamous touchet beds. Gentle landscape, violent past: some of the most catastrophic floods in history, of both the water and lava varieties. Great place to cut one's teeth. I had fantastic professors, and learned the pleasures of a long day of fieldwork followed by a campfire. Proper training, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a stint of trying to save the world, I sold my soul to the oil industry for several years, doing wellsite geology, mostly in the Bakken. But geomorphology called, and I went to UC Santa Barbara for a little graduate earth-sciences education. I'm no longer working in geology, but you can find me waxing poetic anytime I hike (a lot) or somebody gives me an excuse to.
